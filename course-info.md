# Course Info

This project-based course is a follow up to EECS 151: Introduction to Digital Design and Integrated Circuits, where students learn principles, components, and methodologies for large scale digital system design. Students who designed a CPU core in the EECS151 ASIC (application specific integrated circuits) lab integrate their core into a larger System-on-Chip (SoC) using agile hardware design tools such as Chipyard and Chisel, a hardware construction language. While covering the basics of VLSI flows and parameterizable computer architecture, the course focuses on a very hands-on approach and aims to tapeout an SoC utilizing the EECS151 cores by end of semester.

This course spans 13 weeks. Class meets for two hours once a week. Each class begins with a short mini lecture, overview of project status, and check-ins with each team on milestones and obstacles. Students are expected to spend a bit more time each week outside of class time working on their project. There will be a presentation and tapeout poster at the end of the semester - and possibly a SKY130 tapeout.


### Enrolling in EECS151T

Fill out [THIS](https://berkie.ee/eecs151-tapeout-join) form to join! Our DeCal listing from Fall '24 is [https://decal.studentorg.berkeley.edu/courses/7534](https://decal.studentorg.berkeley.edu/courses/7534?ref=ieee.berkeley.edu).


### Prerequisites

This rigorous course is designed for students who have completed EECS 151 LA ASIC and/or EE 194/290C (the traditional 'Tapeout' and 'Bringup' courses). Students who instead completed EECS 151 LB FPGA are welcome but may have a higher learning curve and will be working with the cores of ASIC students. Students who have not completed EECS 151 or Tapeout/Bringup are recommended to take this Decal after having completed the course. Those unsure are welcome to email us. We are extremely welcoming to self-motivated students of various backgrounds but do wish to emphasize that background knowledge will be helpful, especially as this is the first iteration of the course.

### Grading

bCourses will be available. We will keep track of grade-related things mostly in Gradescope. Other course content will be found here on the website and on Github. When in doubt, ask on the Discord: [https://discord.gg/DXbg598wcR](https://discord.gg/DXbg598wcR)

### Office Hours

We may have work and "office hours" sessions. You can also organize your own work sessions. We will use this calendar to track them.
